# Highlands sample project

Sample project containing Java, annotation processing and Kotlin rules.

If you have fresh checkout of this branch, just run make. It will download _Highlands_ scripts from master, then will run thru all generators with a nice colored trace.

```
$ make
```

Prerequisites are Java 8, Facebook Buck, Python 2.7.x, Node, Make, Unzip, Curl

This repository does not contain `.up.lock.json` or `lib` on purpose so those will always be demonstrably generated by `make`. But under normal circumstances `.up.lock.json` and `lib` (or equivalent directory) should be commited to a repostory
